Open the Unzipped PortFolio Folder in VS Code as Adminstrator, and go to the terminal in the VS Code and Type in the following

```
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages at the versions I use.

Then Go to your respective Components And Start Coding....

This is not the final repository model.

Happy Coding!!!
